Even though I stopped coding professionally since 2015, I still have an appreciation to the art and sience of programming. I spend few hours every week week keeping myself up-to-date with programming in general and mobile app development in particular. Sometime when inspiration strike and I have an idea for moble apps that can be useful for others, I publish them. Give these apps a try, your life can be a bit happier or more productive as a result.
