subtitle: The guy who never stop learning

I am a proactive person with a growth mindset, living in Hanoi, Vietnam. My passions are on learning, training & development, solving problems, programming, and generally delivering genuine value to others.

I’ve been working in the software industry since 2008 as Web Master and Software Engineer. I joined Gameloft in 2011, shifting the focus as a programmer from Web to Mobile App and Game Development. Since 2015, I shifted again into full managerial and leadership role, growing people and teams. In my current position as Production Manager, I lead 150+ people across departments working 6+ world-class mobile game projects.

As in 2021, my biggest professional interest is in the intersection of Technology and Learning. My biggest hobby is learning to play the Piano. And my biggest love is undoubtly for my amazing wife, son, and daughter.
